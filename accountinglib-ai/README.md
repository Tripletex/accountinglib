# AccountingLib-AI

**AccountingLib-AI** is an experimental module that brings artificial intelligence capabilities into 
[AccountingLib](https://github.com/andreasrosdal/AccountingLib),
using the [Jlama](https://github.com/tjake/Jlama) Java-native LLM framework.

With Jlama, AccountingLib-AI can run modern AI models directly inside the JVM without external services. This enables:

- **AI-assisted accounting** – automatically classify transactions, suggest ledger accounts, and detect anomalies.
- **Natural language queries** – ask questions about your accounting data in plain English (or Norwegian) and get structured answers.
- **Report generation** – generate custom financial reports from text prompts.
- **Automation** – reduce repetitive bookkeeping tasks with AI-driven insights.

This integration makes **AccountingLib** not only a universal accounting toolkit but also a platform for the next generation of **decentralized, intelligent accounting software**.
